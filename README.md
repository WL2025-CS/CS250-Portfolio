# Sprint Review and Retrospective
This repository includes my final project for SNHU’s CS-250 course, focusing on Agile and Scrum practices applied to the SNHU Travel Application developed by Team ChadaTech.

# Reflection Questions

# 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
I translate user needs into clear user stories that define the goal and value of each feature. This keeps development aligned with what users truly need. For example, our “price-based hotel filter” story ensured we delivered meaningful functionality within one sprint.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs?
I use Agile methods to plan, build, and improve through short sprints. Daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives help maintain progress and adaptability. This approach lets me deliver working software quickly and adjust to change effectively.

# 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
Good teamwork means communicating openly, supporting others, and staying accountable. As Scrum Master, I helped remove obstacles, keep priorities clear, and maintain transparency so the team could deliver complete, high-quality features each sprint.
